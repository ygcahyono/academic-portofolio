        I'm an ongoing graduate student at the University of Edinburgh, majoring in Finance, Technology, and Policy (Fintech).

        My areas of interest include analytical skills, problem-solving, data-engineering and machine learning. I am detail-oriented and enjoy working with product and business teams to drive decisions using data. As my master's specialisation concentrates on FinTech, I have a vast appeal on blockchain and the financial market and am keen to utilise my analytical capabilities to tackle issues in financial sectors.

        Since 2014, I have been blending my analytical with programming skills. My last professional job was at Tokopedia (GoTo Ôºç Holding Company) as an Analytics Lead, supporting Payment and FinTech day-to-day decision-making in Tokopedia.

        **Specialties:** Analytics & Data, Leadership, Programming, Web3, Writing & Editing
